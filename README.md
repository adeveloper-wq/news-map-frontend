# News Map Frontend (Next.js, Typerscript, Mapbox) (work-in-progress)
- Frontend of [this Backend](https://github.com/adeveloper-wq/news-map-backend)
- It visualizes locations of places mentioned in news articles.

## Motivation
- Look at historic data to see when what location was mentioned a lot in news articles
- Compare different news sources (from different countries)

## How to run?
- copy `.env.example`, rename to `.env.local` and fill out with your own variables
- install dependencies: `npm install`
- development server: `npm run dev`
- building: `npm run build`
- run the build: `npm run start`

Why Next.js? Wanted to try it out.
